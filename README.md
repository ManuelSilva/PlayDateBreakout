# Playdate Breakout by Manuel Silva

![Breakout Clone Screenshot](./Breakout.gif)

Ive been playing around with making game on the Playdate with C.
Sharing this since I'm noticing there are not many resources out there for people programming in C for the playdate.

This project can serve as an easy Hello World like template for creating other games.

## Controls

- **Paddle Movement**: Use the crank to move the paddle left and right.

\*There is no ending in the game, game just restarts on loss for now.
